# My midterm project
### I am making a travel website that helps people organizing their itinerary for my capstone. The major feature of this site is that you can search the attractions, restaurants, and plans and make plans at the same time, the same screen. This website contains a plan table and an interactive map that works on the same screen. Before they get into the plan table part, they have to type in the basic travel information such as departure city, destination, arrival date, and return date. 
### My midterm project for dynamic data class is building this feature for the landing page.  The first page of this project is a button leading to a form. You can create a name for your trip, choose the departure city, destination city, choose arrival date and return date. Based on user's choice of different cities, the database will generate a picture of the city corresponding to their choice, and calculate their travel days at the same time.
